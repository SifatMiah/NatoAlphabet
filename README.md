NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator

This is a simple Python script that converts a user-inputted word into its NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent. It uses an embedded version of the NATO phonetic alphabet â€” no external CSV file needed!

ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The script contains the full NATO phonetic alphabet as a string.
2. It loads the data into a dictionary using `pandas`.
3. When the user inputs a word, it converts each letter to its corresponding phonetic code.
4. The output is a list of phonetic words printed to the console.
